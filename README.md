# etch-a-sketch
This is a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The divs are created using JavaScript and the grid squares are inside a "container" div, which is written in the HTML file.

Flexbox is used to make the dibs appear as a grid.
A hover effect is applied so taht the grid divs change color when your mouse apssed over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid like a pen would.

There is a button on the top of the screen that sends the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid is be removed, and a new grid is be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that there is a new sketch pad.
